               </li>

               <p>8/10. It's like fall/spring weather for yall but it only last 3 months TOPS.
                  Plus lots of random hot days. We've experience several Christmas with 85 degree weather. Sun is 
                  completely down at 6:00 PM. Things feel right during this time. This is the sunniest time of the year.
               </p>

                  <h3>Spring -- St. Louis, MO</h3>
               </li>

               <p>8/10. Beautiful transition from winter to spring. 
                  Nature is illuminating during this time. 
                  Trees like I've never seen before. Seriously thought that Spring colors were a myth.

                  <h3>Fall -- St. Louis, MO</h3>
               </li>

               <p>7/10. Less a point than spring because why the heck does fall weather only last a month? 
                  It was a glorious month and the trees are brillant. 
                  Nobody told me how fast things change. Monday we had trees full of leaves, and Thursday
                  75% are completely gone.

               <p>6/10. Where's the snow first of all. The worst of it is just icy and wet. The best is 
                  the glittery snow and snowflakes so detailed its beyond me. 
                  Seeing a deer in snow was surreal. Wearing layers kind of sucks if you have to constantly take
                  them off but at least there's no sweat involved.

               </li>
                  
               <p>4/10. Maybe last 2 weeks and then you'll start sweating profusely. 
               </p>

                  <h3>Summer -- St. Louis, MO</h3>
               </li>
               <p>4/10. Y'all summers gets just as hot and humid as Florida. 
                  But at least y'all get a break. And random days where it's kind of cool out (for me as a FL).
               </p>

               <p>3/10 There is no such thing as fall in Central Florida and going south. This screenshot
                  was taken 10/14/2017. This represents the joy of seeing a day with a high in the 70s. 
                  It most likely felt like 90 degrees that day. 
               </p>

               <p>0/10. The minute you go outside you feel yourself sweating in areas you don't want to be. 
                  Good luck if you have no a/c in your car. Best thing to do is ignore it. 
                  It's a hell for 9 months and it always rains. "Scattered showers" is an everyday thing. It's either a 
                  severe thunderstorm that will last for less than an hour or 5 mins of random
                  rain showers throughout the day. Not uncommon to see your backyard pouring rain and the front
                  yard dry as can be. It's so hot, I personally hibernate.
