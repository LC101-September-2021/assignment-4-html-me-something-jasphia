      <h1 class="text-center" id="mainHeading">Top Seasons between St. Louis, MO and Brevard County, FL</h1>
      <h3 class="text-center" style="padding: 25px;">It's officially been a year since I moved to the
         midwest. Prior to that, I lived in Florida. Never seen snow, fall leaves, or spring bloom until this year.
         Here is my review of the seasons between my hometown and St. Louis.

               </li>

               <p>8/10. Beautiful transition from winter to spring. 
                  Nature is illuminating during this time. 
                  Trees blooming colors I thought could only exist in my imagination.

                  <h3>Winter -- <em>Brevard County, FL</em></h3>
               </li>

               <p>7.5/10. It's like fall/spring weather for yall but it only last 3 months <b>tops</b>.
                  Plus lots of random hot days. We've experience several Christmases in shorts. Sun is 
                  completely down at 6:00 PM. Things feel right during this time. This is the sunniest time of the year.

                  <h3>Fall -- <em>St. Louis, MO</em></h3>
               </li>

               <p>7/10. It only last a month. Why?
                  It was a glorious month and the trees are brillant. 
                  Nobody told me how fast things change. Monday we had trees full of leaves, and Thursday
                  75% are completely gone.

               </li>
               
               <p>6/10. The worst of it is just icy and wet. The best is 
                  the glittery snow and snowflakes so detailed its beyond me. Beauty that I could only see on a screen until now. 
                  Seeing a deer in snow was surreal. Wearing layers kind of sucks if you have to constantly take
                  them off but at least there's no sweat involved.

               <p>4/10. Maybe last 2 weeks and then you'll start sweating profusely. Also lovebug season.

               </li>
               <p>4/10. Summer gets just as hot and humid as Florida. 
                  But at least you get a break. Random days where it's kind of cool out is a plus.

                  <h3>Fall -- <em>Brevard County, FL</em></h3>
               </li>

               <p>3/10 There is no such thing as fall in Central Florida and going south. This screenshot
                  was taken 10/14/2017. This represents the joy of seeing a day with a high in the 70s. 
                  It most likely felt like 90 degrees that day BUT with a cool breeze. Also still dealing with hurricane season.

               <p>0/10. The moment you walk outside, you can already feel yourself producing sweat in every place of your body.
                  Humidity slaps you in the face.
                  It's an inescapable 9 months of suffering. "Scattered showers" is an everyday thing. It's either a 
                  severe thunderstorm that will last for about an hour or 5 mins of random
                  rain showers throughout the day. Hot rain. Not uncommon to see your backyard pouring rain and the front
                  yard dry as can be. It's so hot, I personally hibernate. Hurricanes usually pop up August - October.
                  By far the most uncomfortable season I've ever experienced.
